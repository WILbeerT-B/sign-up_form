Introduction
This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items you’ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it’s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

GOAL: 
To build a sign-up form and be able to: 
1. Familiarize the form basics and validations
2. Have a basic idea on how to style forms

ABOUT:
I plan to build this project by duplicating the design file.
